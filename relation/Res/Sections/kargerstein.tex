This is a randomized algorithm for the computation of a graph.
In the next subsections we explain how we have implemented the data structure and the functions of the algorithm.

\subsection{Data Structure}
For the implementation of the algortihm we used:
\begin{itemize}
	\item  \textbf{k}: is a constant ($log^2n$) used by Karger to repeat Recursive-Contract k times and to obtain an error with probability less or equal to 1/n;
	\item  \textbf{V}: is the list of nodes;
	\item  \textbf{D}: is the list of the sum of the weights of each node;
	\item  \textbf{W}: is the list of the graph with 3 parameters(node,node,weight). Each node is connected with the others and if they are not connected the third parameter is set to 0 otherwise is set to the correct weight.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Implementation}
For the implementation of the algorithm we used these functions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item  \textbf{Karger(G,k)}: 
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item  This is the main function of the algorithm where we set the timeout to 60 to limit the execution time of large instances;
		\item  We start the time and we set the minimum cut to infinite;
		\item  We iterate k times to obtain an error with probability less or equal to 1/n;
		\item  If the time minus the starting time is greater than the timeout we break;
		\item  We execute a copy of V,W and D and then we call the function Recursive-Contract;
		\item  If we found a value less than our minimum we update it  and we set the discovery time;
		\item  In the end we print the Minimum Cut, the Total time and the discovery time.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item  \textbf{Recursive-Contract(V, W, D)}: In this function we follow exactly the function above with our data structure;
	\item  \textbf{Contract(s, V,  W, D)}: Also in this function we follow the function above. The only difference is that when we select and contract an edge (u,v) then we remove from V the vertex V to respect the contraction;
	\item  \textbf{Contract-Edge(u,v, W, D)}: Also in this case we follow the function above (We update D and W with the new values to execute the contraction of the edge) with our data structure;
	\item  \textbf{Edge-Select(V1, D, W)}: Edge selecting randome select first node and look for connected other node, algorithm use:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item  \textbf{Random-Select(C)}:
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item  Build Ð¡umulative weights vector by input array of weights
			\item  Set random value \textbf{r} in range (0, max value of weight)
			\item  Run binary search  to return node related to selected edge 
			\end{enumerate}
		\item  \textbf{binarySearch(array, x)}:
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item  Special case of binary search according to inequality C[i - 1] $\leq$ r $<$ C[i]
			\item  Devide array in parts
			\item  Check first value of right part, if random value higher, then go right
			\item  If value lower check that previous element lower or equal 
			\item  Return ralated name of node 
			\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
