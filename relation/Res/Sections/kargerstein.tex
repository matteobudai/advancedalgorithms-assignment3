This is a randomized algorithm for the computation of a graph.
In the next subsections we explain how we have implemented the data structure and the functions of the algorithm.

\subsection{Data Structure}
For the implementation of the algortihm we used:
\begin{itemize}
	\item  \textbf{k}: is a constant ($log^2n$) used by Karger to repeat Recursive-Contract k times and to obtain an error with probability less or equal to 1/n;
	\item  \textbf{V}: is the list of nodes;
	\item  \textbf{D}: is the list of the sum of the weights of each node;
	\item  \textbf{W}: is the list of the graph with 3 parameters(node,node,weight). Each node is connected with the others and if they are not connected the third parameter is set to 0 otherwise is set to the correct weight.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Implementation}
For the implementation of the algorithmwe used these functions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item  \textbf{Karger(G,k)}: ;
	\item  \textbf{Recursive-Contract(V, W, D)}: ;
	\item  \textbf{Contract(s, V,  W, D)}: ;
	\item  \textbf{Contract-Edge(u,v, W, D)}: ;
	\item  \textbf{Edge-Select(V1, D, W)}: that used:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item  \textbf{Random-Select(C)}: ;
		\item  \textbf{binarySearch(array, x)}: .
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
