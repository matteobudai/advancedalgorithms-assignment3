\section{Conclusion}
As we can see from the results table, the execution time of Karger Stein greatly increases at 100 nodes, going from less than one second to complete the algorithm to over four seconds. The execution time exponentially grows, and eventually starts to time out at the implemented time limit of 120 seconds once the graph exceeds 350 nodes. The execution time of Stoer Wagner also increases as the nodes increase, but not as dramatically as Karger Stein. Even with the largest file of 500 nodes, the Stoer Wagner algorithm takes less than a second to complete. Due to the large difference in the execution time, and considering that Stoer Wagner is a deterministic algorithm, we can conclude that Stoer Wagner is not only better than Karger Stein but is also more efficient.
