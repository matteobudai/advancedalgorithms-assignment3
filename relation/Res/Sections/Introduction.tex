\section{Introduction}
For this assignment, we implemented and analyzed the performance of two algorithms for the min-cut problem for weighted graphs. The algorithms implemented are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Stoer and Wagner's Deterministic Algorithm;
	\item Karger and Stein's Randomized Algorithm.
\end{enumerate}
